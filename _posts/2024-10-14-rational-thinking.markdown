Whenever I have a debate with my friends over something we disagree about, everybody starts with what appears to be well-structured and logical arguments for their opinions. 

Over the course of our debate, we usually present our arguments to each other and pick apart these arguments to expose them for logical flaws. Eventually, if we’re lucky, we end up with a composition of a few logical arguments that don’t seem to have any flaws and decide that a particular outcome “makes sense”

But does the fact that an argument “makes sense” necessarily mean that it is true?

Of course not, but you might say that even though it’s not conclusive, it’s still better than relying on emotion/instinct/intuition.

But can you prove that?

Can you even prove that an argument making sense implies a higher probability of it being right?

### Rational thinking vs empirical observation
It’s important to note the difference between making decisions backed by data and observation, versus pure logic (and a combination of both).

For example, when you choose a car based on its mileage, you’re not acting on the basis on logic and reason alone - you’re relying on hard numbers that have been generated after rigorous testing and observation

If you choose a Toyota because it’s reliable, it’s still not pure rational thinking, because you’re relying on the observed experience of millions of car owners

I have absolutely no qualms about making decisions purely based on empirical data, but I do feel uneasy relying on pure logic or even logic combined with evidence

But what do we do when there’s no empirical evidence, when we do have data but it’s difficult to tie it to a decision, or when it straight up doesn’t make sense to use empirical evidence?

I see people use rational thinking for so many personal decisions - choosing a career, investing & personal finance, deciding whether to date someone, whether they should have kids, who to vote for, etc. 

Is rational thinking really the best option for these decisions?

### Gradient descent
Gradient descent is a technique in machine learning, where the computer tries to get better at a predictive task with time. It starts off with a wrong guess, then keeps making changes until it arrives at an optimal solution.

It kinda looks like this -

The important thing to note with gradient descent is that the algorithm gets better with time. **What’s even more important to note is that every step it takes almost always gets it closer to the optimal solution.**

This has not been my experience with rationality; instead, it’s been comparable to the motion of a double pendulum -

Perhaps you’ve had a similar experience - maybe you’ve changed your political opinions multiple times over the years. Maybe you’ve changed careers often, and are still debating a change. Maybe you’ve been having an internal debate over where to live and keep flip-flopping between SF and NYC!

We all have very complex thoughts and emotions that are hard to articulate, but it feels like rational thinking forces you to only consider simpler thoughts that can be easily expressed by words.

Let’s take the abstract case of having to choose between multiple options.
Let’s say that after a long internal debate, you’ve composed a bunch of logical arguments and have landed on one of the options

Can you conclusively prove that each of those logical arguments are true? Or do they only make sense?

What if your mind simply forgets to validate one of those arguments?

Are you sure you’ve thought of all the possible options to choose from? Can you conclusively prove that those are the only options available?

Perhaps those options are not too different from each other, but what about a case where each option has a starkly different ethical consequence? In such a case, mistakes can be extremely costly

Do you even have the time to be so thorough?

Every time you discover a flaw in one of your arguments, you might end up choosing a completely different option. 

**It seems like there’s no guarantee that the more time you spend, the closer you get to the solution when you use rational thinking**

You can always come up with new flawed arguments that cause you to discard the old, saner ones

### The extent of the fallibility of rationality
I believe that rational thinking is **so** fallible, that you could really justify **any** opinion by composing sufficiently smart rational arguments that “make sense”

Just like these people on the internet have -

### “But I’m smart, so my rational thinking is not as fallible!”
Although some studies do show that there is a correlation with IQ and reasoning + analytical thinking, there’s no evidence that it is ever infallible

Here’s one of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s (arguably the most prominent rationalist alive) famous posts [Torture vs. Dust specks](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks), where he argues that it might be better to have a person horribly tortured for 50 years than have a speck of dust put into a large number of people’s eyes. This seems to be something a large part of the rationalist community (who definitely seem to be smarter than average) agree with

Ted Kaczynski (a.k.a. The Unabomber) had an IQ of 167 - probably smarter than anyone most of us will ever meet in our lives, and yet he decided to kill three people and injure 23 others because he thought it made sense. When his manifesto was initially published, [people thought it was intellectually deep and sane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Society_and_Its_Future#CITEREFChase2000:~:text=With%20its%20initial%20publication%20in%201995%2C%20the%20manifesto%20was%20received%20as%20intellectually%20deep%20and%20sane)

You could say that you’re smart in other ways, in ways that cannot be captured by an IQ test. But if you can’t objectively explain the reasons why your reasoning is perfect, how can you be sure?

### Is rational thinking ok if we back it up with empirical data?
Sometimes, we’re lucky, and empirical evidence outright gives us the solution we were looking for, with no need for rational thinking. \
For example, we could try debating whether Amoxicillin would help with pneumonia by thinking of all the ways the particular chemical structure of the drug could interact with bacterial cells and our own cells, and then maybe come to a conclusion where it makes sense that it would kill bacterial cells and not harm our own. \
Or, we could simply look at all the historical drug trials Amoxicillin has gone through and immediately learn that it indeed combats pneumonia effectively

But this is not always possible. \
What if, for example, you’re trying to evaluate whether a company is going to succeed? In most cases it’s impossible to obtain empirical evidence which directly proves the direction of the company

You may look at historical performance, its growth rate, its profitability, the balance sheet, the CEO’s previous success, the amount of debt it’s carrying, the general economic conditions, etc. But none of those directly give you an answer, you’d have to use some rational thinking to tie these variables to the outcome. How successful of an investor can you become by doing this?

Unfortunately, people who do exactly this don’t seem to have great performance.

If you look at all of the active mutual funds in the US, about 2000+ of them, none of them ended up beating the S&P 500 convincingly over a five year period from 2018 [[source](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/business/stock-market-index-funds.html)]

If you look at a 20 year period starting from 2002, only 10% of these mutual funds beat the index.

These mutual funds are probably filled with some of the smartest people, some of them probably hire economics and math PhDs. They’ve probably been analyzing the stock market for decades \
And yet, all you have to do to beat them is just blindly invest in the biggest 500 companies in the country - barely any thinking required

It’s important to note that I am not saying that you shouldn’t invest in mutual funds, or that you shouldn’t try to pick stocks. All I’m saying is that it’s too easy to come up with a convincing rational argument for why a stock will go up, when it actually won’t

### What is rational thinking good for?
I don’t have any problems with rational thinking that provides some kind of mathematical certainty. If you’re building a rocket, for example, math & physics (a form of rational thinking?) can help you decide how fast it needs to go to escape gravity

You could also use rational thinking to decide what sort of empirical data to collect, but I have a feeling that the most impactful of these kinds of decisions are powered by intuition and curiosity anyway

### What else can we do if not think rationally?
Using rational thinking for very complex decisions, especially when stakes are high, seems to be dangerous. Especially when you don’t have enough time to carefully vet your logical arguments. In some cases, you might only find flaws in them years after making the “rational” decision

Perhaps, for complex personal decisions, it makes sense to not even consider rational arguments

Hopefully, empathy, intuition, curiosity, instinct, and other kinds of non-rational thinking are good enough for most decisions in life.
