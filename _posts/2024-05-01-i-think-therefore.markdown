Am I real? Is there any proof that I exist? Is there any proof that the things I see, hear, touch, and smell are real? These are the questions Descartes asked himself a few centuries ago.


At first glance, these questions seem trivial and obvious. But haven’t we all had times when we thought something was real, but it wasn’t? People who frequent deserts can tell you how convincing a mirage can be. But you might say that that’s different because mirages are widely known to be optical illusions. To which I would say - have you never had an incorrect perception of what is widely known? 


More importantly - what if you have no idea about popular, established scientific opinion? What if you’re in the middle of a desert without knowing what a mirage is, and you see some cool, blue, refreshing water on the horizon? You’d still probably find out that it’s not real after walking towards it for hours and still finding it equally distant from you. But, this scenario is easy to verify because the illusion breaks down at some point. What if you encounter an illusion that is much harder to verify?


Descartes’ questioning is more fundamental - can we believe what our thoughts/emotions tell us? When we drink a tall glass of cool water on a hot day, are we actually experiencing the quenching of our thirst, or are we just imagining it?


Descartes believed that a “demon” could simply be putting thoughts (/emotions) in our heads (including the concept of a “head” and the sense of being inside one), and there’s no way to verify that they’re true (today, we can think of better alternatives, for example—we could be living in a simulation).


He said that although we can never verify whether the things around us are real, it is indisputable that you are real. Your thoughts and emotions might be an illusion, but you’re still real because you’re there to observe and notice them.


This is where many people disagree with Descartes.\
The assumption here is that the observer is different from the thoughts/emotions being observed.\
Isn’t the sense of being an observer just another thought?


(Now you’re probably trying to observe the sense of being an “observer”)


If I’m not even the observer of my thoughts and emotions since the sense of being an observer is just a thought, then who/what am “I”?
